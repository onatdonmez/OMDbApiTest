# OmdbApiTest
I created and tested the following cases using the public api at http://www.omdbapi.com/

1.Search for "Harry Potter" with the parameters under the heading "By Search" and get the id of the movie "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" from the results.

2.Search movies with this id in the methods under "By ID or Title".

General:
1.You have to do this in Java language in a maven project where you use the Rest Assured library.
2.In the response, it will be enough to check whether the title, year, released fields of the data are displayed and the http status.
